**Crop Yield Prediction Project**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning algorithms and historical climate data. The goal is to provide farmers and agricultural organizations with a tool to estimate future crop yields, enabling them to make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation.

**Project Structure**
---------------------

The project is organized into the following directories:

* `src`: Contains the source code for the project, including data loading, preprocessing, and modeling.
* `data`: Contains the raw data used for training and testing the models.
* `models`: Contains the trained models and their corresponding performance metrics.
* `results`: Contains the predicted crop yields and evaluation metrics.

**Data**
--------

The project uses two datasets:

* `crop_data.csv`: Contains historical crop yield data, including features such as crop type, region, and year.
* `climate_data.csv`: Contains historical climate data, including features such as temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.

**Preprocessing**
-----------------

The data is preprocessed using the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove rows with missing values and convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Scale the data using Standard Scaler to ensure that all features have zero mean and unit variance.

**Modeling**
------------

The project uses a linear regression model to predict crop yields. The model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

**Model Evaluation**
--------------------

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
* **R-squared (R2)**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

**Usage**
---------

To use the project, follow these steps:
